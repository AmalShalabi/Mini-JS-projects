# JavaScript and CSS Mini Projects 
JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that is essential for web development. To help developers improve their skills and gain experience with JavaScript & CSS, I have compiled a list of mini projects and exercises that cover a wide range of topics.

These projects are designed to help developers improve their skills and gain experience with JavaScript and CSS. They can be completed in any order and can be modified to suit the developer's needs and interests.
