# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that is often used to teach basic programming concepts. The game is simple to play, but offers endless opportunities for strategy and skill development.

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking a square with their X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
